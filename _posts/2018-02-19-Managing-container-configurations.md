<h2>Introduction</h2>
Configurations are an important part of an application and therefore they
are also needed in the container's world.

In this post I will describe some methods used to deal with configurations.

<h2>Methods to deal with configurations</h2>
<h3>Integrating configuration files within the image</h3>
This option allows you to have an homogeneous and standardized application,
since every instance of the application will have the same configuration files,
but on the other hand this will also force you to build an image every time a
configuration file changes.

<h3>Mapping files through bind mounts</h3>
This will map your files directly to your containers using `--mount` or `-v`
flags.

It will make your image more dynamic and it will able you to not build an image
every time you change a configuration file, but it also means that you will
have to put the files on the host machine and map them properly.

You will also need to be careful to not expose sensitive information.

<h3>Passing environment variables</h3>
This approach will keep container dynamic, since all you have to do is pass the
variables to inside the container, which can be done using `-e` flag.

<h3>Using Docker Configs and Docker Secrets</h3>
If you are using [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) you can
use [Docker Configs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/configs/) and [Docker
Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) to deploy your
configurations and secrets in a secure way, without the need to build an image
every time you change a configuration and without the need to map disk sections.

Check [this post](https://diogomonica.com/2017/03/27/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data/)
from Diogo MÃ³nica, the Security Lead at [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), on
how this should be a better way of deploying your secrets rather than using
environment variables.

<h3>Pulling configurations at start up time</h3>
You can use a configuration management tool like [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/)
or [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) to pull configurations at container's start up
time.

This may not be advisable tho because you want your container to be as
lightweight as it can, therefore it should be small and start fast.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
There are many ways for managing container configurations and none of them are
mutually exclusive.

You can, for example, pull the configurations at start up time, using a
configuration management tool, and change them afterwards using environment
variables.

Also there are many tools that can help with managing this setups. You should
use what best suits you.
